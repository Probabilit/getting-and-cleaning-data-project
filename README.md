2. Read the various tables on subjects, activities, features, and data across training and test data.   
3. Merge the training and test data across subject, activity, and data. 
4. Subset the merged table keeping only data pertaining to mean or standard deviation. 
5. Assign descriptive activity names instead of numbers. 
6. Assign descriptive names to variables. 
7. Create a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
